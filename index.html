  Hi, my name is wrath. I am writing here to just tell everyone how sorry I am for my actions.<br>
  What I did was shamefully wrong and I am so deeply and truly sorry, both to the victims and to their friends and families, and to other friends I had that I have disappointed.<br>
  I am disgusted with my actions, as all of you are probably feeling too. I should have never done what I did. It was wrong.<br>
  I never done this because they were minors, I did this because I was horny and stupid and I stupidly consented to receiving and giving pictures and I should have never done so.<br>
  This was a massive mistake on my part, I should have never done any of this and I should have listened to people more, especially the people that loved me most that I betrayed and made them heartbroken. All I have to say is you were 100% right about them and I should have listened to you from the beginning. I know you were looking out for the best of my interests and I am so sorry that I betrayed you and then further failed to listen to you.<br>
  To everyone else who is disgusted by my actions. I am aware and I am so deeply and truly sorry. I have let you all down and I let myself down. I hate that I got myself into this situation.<br>
  This will probably be the last time I will ever go public. I have no plans to contact anyone again, and those alternative accounts that popped up following this were not me.<br>
  <br>
  I am sorry for what I have done.<br>
